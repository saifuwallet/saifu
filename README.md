# Saifu Docs

This is the docs repository for Saifu. Use any markdown editor of choice, but the recommendation is to use something that can work with backlinks, like:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (free to use)
- [Nota](https://nota.md/) (free but nags with purchase reminders)

## How to find information

- Use the search above
- Click "Go to file" and type in a few terms of what you need
- Use your editors quick open (`CMD-O`) and fuzzy-find through that way
