# How to connect to a dApp
With Saifu wallet you can connect to any dapp that supports connecting Phantom or Slope Wallet. 


## 1. Open Wallet Adapter Settings
Once you have your wallet unlocked click on the account icon on the top right to open the Account page.

From the **Account** page, navigate to **Settings**, then  **Wallet Adapter**.
Once you click on **Wallet Adapter**, you should be able to select the wallet adapter you would like to use.

## 2. Connect to dApp 
Once the wallet settings have been updated, go to the dApp you'd like to connect to.

*Note: If you have already opened the dApp before setting up your wallet, make sure to refresh the page. This ensures the chrome extension is able to inject the adapter properly.*

Choose the wallet adapter that was set during step 1 (in this case **Phantom**) and click on connect. Once the wallet opens a **Connection Request** popup click on **Approve**.

## 3. Interact with the dApp
If you are familiar with other wallets, this shouldn't be foreign to you.
